### Dependencies

- Bower is used to link GitHub assets, namely our [Octicons](http://octicons.github.com) icon font and Markdown styles.
- Autoprefixer is included with a gem, [`octopress-autoprefixer`](https://github.com/octopress/autoprefixer).
- A custom plugin for snippet and example combos, `example.rb`, was created as a fork of Jekyll's built-in `highlight` plugin.
